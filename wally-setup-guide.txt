                    WALLY SETUP GUIDE FOR MAC
                    (No coding experience needed!)
================================================================================

This guide will walk you through setting up Wally on your Mac. Each step
includes exactly what to click or type. Don't worry if you've never used
Terminal before - just follow along!


================================================================================
STEP 1: INSTALL NODE.JS
================================================================================

Node.js is the engine that runs Wally. Here's how to install it:

1. Open your web browser (Safari, Chrome, etc.)
2. Go to: https://nodejs.org
3. You'll see two green download buttons - click the one that says "LTS"
   (LTS means "Long Term Support" - it's the stable version)
4. A file will download (something like "node-v20.x.x.pkg")
5. Open your Downloads folder and double-click the file
6. Follow the installer:
   - Click "Continue" on each screen
   - Click "Agree" to accept the license
   - Click "Install"
   - Enter your Mac password when asked
   - Click "Close" when finished

That's it! Node.js is now installed.


================================================================================
STEP 2: OPEN TERMINAL
================================================================================

Terminal is where you'll type commands to set up and run Wally.

1. Press Command + Space (the Command key has a ⌘ symbol)
2. A search bar appears - type: Terminal
3. Press Enter (or click "Terminal" in the results)

A window will open with a blinking cursor. This is Terminal!

TIP: You might want to keep Terminal in your Dock for easy access. While
Terminal is open, right-click its icon in the Dock and choose
"Options" > "Keep in Dock"


================================================================================
STEP 3: INSTALL GIT
================================================================================

Git is a tool that downloads and updates Wally's code.

In Terminal, type this command and press Enter:

    git --version

What happens next:

- If you see something like "git version 2.x.x" -> Git is already installed!
  Skip to Step 4.

- If a popup appears asking to install "developer tools" or "Xcode Command
  Line Tools" -> Click "Install" and wait for it to finish (this may take
  several minutes). When done, close and reopen Terminal.


================================================================================
STEP 4: CHOOSE WHERE TO INSTALL WALLY
================================================================================

Let's put Wally in your Documents folder. In Terminal, type:

    cd ~/Documents

Then press Enter.

(The "cd" command means "change directory" - you're telling Terminal to
go to your Documents folder)


================================================================================
STEP 5: DOWNLOAD WALLY
================================================================================

Now we'll download Wally's code. In Terminal, type:

    git clone https://github.com/alec2020/wally.git

Press Enter and wait for the download to complete. You'll see progress
messages as files are downloaded.

When it's done, go into the Wally folder by typing:

    cd wally

Press Enter.


================================================================================
STEP 6: INSTALL WALLY'S REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

Wally needs some additional software to run. Install it by typing:

    npm install

Press Enter and wait. You'll see lots of text scrolling by - this is normal!
It may take a few minutes. Wait until you see the cursor blinking again.

NOTE: You might see some "WARN" messages - these are usually fine to ignore.
Only worry if you see "ERR!" messages in red.


================================================================================
STEP 7: START WALLY
================================================================================

You're ready to run Wally! Type:

    npm run dev

Press Enter. After a few seconds, you'll see a message like:

    ▲ Next.js 14.x.x
    - Local: http://localhost:3000

Now:
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: http://localhost:3000
3. Wally should appear!

IMPORTANT: Keep Terminal open while using Wally. The Terminal window is
running Wally - if you close it, Wally stops working.


================================================================================
STEP 8: SET UP AI FEATURES (OPTIONAL)
================================================================================

Wally can use AI to automatically read your bank statements. This requires
an API key from OpenRouter.

If you want to skip this for now, that's fine! You can add transactions
manually and set up AI later.

To set up AI:

1. Go to: https://openrouter.ai
2. Create an account (you can sign in with Google)
3. Add some credit ($5 is plenty to start)
4. Go to "Keys" in your OpenRouter dashboard
5. Click "Create Key"
6. Copy the key (it starts with "sk-or-")
7. In Wally, click the Settings icon (gear) in the sidebar
8. Paste your API key and save


================================================================================
STEP 9: DAY-TO-DAY USAGE
================================================================================

Every time you want to use Wally:

TO START WALLY:
1. Open Terminal (Command + Space, type "Terminal", press Enter)
2. Type: cd ~/Documents/wally
3. Press Enter
4. Type: npm run dev
5. Press Enter
6. Open your browser to: http://localhost:3000

TO STOP WALLY:
1. Go to the Terminal window
2. Press Control + C (this stops the server)
3. You can now close Terminal

TIP: Wally stores all your data locally in a file called "finance.db" -
your financial data never leaves your computer!


================================================================================
STEP 10: GETTING UPDATES
================================================================================

Occasionally, Wally gets new features and fixes. Here's how to update:

1. Make sure Wally is stopped (Control + C in Terminal if it's running)
2. In Terminal, make sure you're in the Wally folder:

       cd ~/Documents/wally

3. Download the latest changes:

       git pull

4. Install any new requirements:

       npm install

5. Start Wally again:

       npm run dev


================================================================================
STEP 11: TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

PROBLEM: "command not found: npm" or "command not found: node"
SOLUTION: Node.js didn't install correctly. Go back to Step 1 and reinstall.
          After installing, close Terminal completely and reopen it.

PROBLEM: "command not found: git"
SOLUTION: Git didn't install. Go back to Step 3 and run "git --version"
          again to trigger the installer.

PROBLEM: "npm install" shows errors with "ERR!"
SOLUTION: Try these steps:
          1. Delete the problem folder: rm -rf node_modules
          2. Try again: npm install

PROBLEM: "EACCES permission denied"
SOLUTION: There's a permissions issue. Try:
          sudo npm install
          (You'll need to enter your Mac password)

PROBLEM: "address already in use" when starting
SOLUTION: Something else is using port 3000. Either:
          - Find and quit the other application, OR
          - Start Wally on a different port: npm run dev -- -p 3001
            (Then go to http://localhost:3001 instead)

PROBLEM: Can't connect to localhost:3000
SOLUTION:
          - Make sure Terminal shows Wally is running (you should see the
            Next.js message)
          - Try: http://127.0.0.1:3000 instead
          - Make sure no VPN is running

PROBLEM: AI/PDF parsing isn't working
SOLUTION:
          - Check your OpenRouter API key is entered correctly in Settings
          - Make sure you have credit in your OpenRouter account
          - Some bank statements have unusual formats - try a different one

PROBLEM: Everything broke and nothing works!
SOLUTION: Start fresh:
          1. cd ~/Documents
          2. rm -rf wally
          3. Go back to Step 5 and re-download


================================================================================

2. Open a new issue describing your problem

Remember: There are no stupid questions! Everyone starts somewhere.
